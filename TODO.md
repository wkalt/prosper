**TODO**:

## phase 1
* can we store new events more efficiently? things don't change often
* input schema validation
* tests
* automated package testing
* daemonized collection
* where will collection run? set up backups
* log rotation
* start running collection in production
* make db connection handling more efficient
* create a way to start and stop querying and the service itself

## phase 2
* web interface / investment tracking / reporting
* investment functions

## phase 3 (maybe concurrent with 2)
* historical data analysis and selection model development
* analysis of recent purchasing data to assess speed of competition 
* purchasing infrastructure (maybe a short-lived cloud deployment in SF? need
  to test connection speeds and competition and see what matters)
